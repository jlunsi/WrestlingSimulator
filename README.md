# Wrestling Simulator
This is a C# Wrestling Simulator that I wrote. To be expanded in the future to allow more match types, and to have better AI.

This was mostly put up on GitHub for showcasing some of my code to potential employers, but if you happen to somehow find this, you may play around with it nonetheless. But do be warned, this is an early version, so the matches generated aren't that exciting, and the moveslist isn't particularly large right now (just over 30 moves).

# How to add wrestlers
Simply create a new file in the wrestler folder with the '.wrestler' extension. Without that, the wrestler will not be read.

# How to add moves
Either add a new file in the moves folder with the '.moves' extension, or write new moves within the already existing move file. Be careful, as you cannot have 2 moves with the same move ID.
